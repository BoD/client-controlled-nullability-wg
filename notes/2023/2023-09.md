[Notes](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1FtUGnrYaAr7iLROLkcRh9JLYnxV0LIxGxfi_HtpMiNo/edit?usp=sharing):

- True Nullability idea came about from discussions between Relay team
  - Shielding the user from null or explicitly handle them
- Being able to mark cache items as ‘errored’ is important
  - Ability to distinguish between error and null
- Assumption that null bubbling exists to ensure type safety in the response
- True Nullability brings the idea of combining errors and returned fields to still ensure type safety
  - Once we forgo null bubbling we can stop needing to have schemas with all fields nullable
- Maybe moving away from JSON as the response could let us have an error state for fields that have errored
  - That might be a pretty big lift getting it into the spec so maybe separating that from this is better
- There is a tension between existing spec which does not distinguish between server and client, and this proposal which pushes some of the responsibility to the client
- Jordan: Maybe not. We’re just offering a mode of execution that makes a softer assertion about type safety. Clients are then free to make a different contract with their users (you will never get an error)
- Deprecating fields - does nullability actually help?
- Simple clients do exist
  - Often for scripts or tools that update indexes/etc
- While making a nullable field non-nullable is technically non-breaking change, it will break existing clients since they will observe much more destruction due to null bubble
- Alex: I wouldn’t be mad if we end up bypassing CCN and end up with True Nullability Schema
- Jordan: A question we should ask, is would `!` be an anti-pattern if we do end up in a True Nullability Schema world. Would we end up wanting to lint against `!`, since it’s making assertions that are unsafe? That’s the only reason not to continue pursuing CCN.
  - I believe TypeScript has a config option that makes `!` (non-null assertion operator) forbidden or at least a warning.
